# Data-Mining-to-Detect-Depression-
Created a project for a Data Mining course to detect depression by implementing various deep learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-means Clustering, and Logistic Regression. Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable and accurate predictions.
